🚀 Draggable and Animated Card Slider
In this project, I developed a draggable and animated card slider using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The slider allows users to smoothly drag through a set of cards, which are animated as they move, providing a dynamic and interactive experience. The goal was to create a user-friendly, visually appealing component that could be easily integrated into any web project.

The slider is designed to be fully interactive, offering drag-and-drop functionality along with animated transitions. Users can click and drag to slide through the cards or simply let the animations take over for an automatic transition effect. The project showcases the power of CSS animations combined with the flexibility of JavaScript for creating smooth and engaging web components.

🌟 Features
✔ Draggable Cards – Users can click and drag to move through the cards.
